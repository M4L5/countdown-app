## The assignment
Make a responsive countdown app in angular. The text should resize and fill the screen's width in portrait and landscape mode, aswell as for desktop and have no linebreaks.
Fetch a quote from an api every time the page loads and doesn't cache the quote locally. If the quote is loading, show a loading spinner.

I followed the design where the logo and quote is showing in portrait mode, but not in landscape mode.

!Note!
Project updated so that the user can input their own title and date. Midsummer Eve and the date is default
